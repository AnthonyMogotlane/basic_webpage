                        <p>The materials used to build the Castle were local and included rock cut from the granite
                            outcrop on Signal Hill, and blue slate and shells – transported from Robben Island. </p>
                        <p>The Castle of Good Hope was not built by Jan Van Riebeeck. A four-pointed clay and timber
                            fort was the first building to be erected in his time, and it was his suggestion that this
                            be replaced by a more permanent structure that could withstand the elements and possible
                            attacks. The existing stone “star fort” was built four years after Jan van Riebeeck left the
                            Cape </p>
                        <p>The Castle was built by soldiers, volunteers, slaves and Khoi undergoing punishment. The
                            building housed everything from a church, bakery and living quarters, to various workshops,
                            shops and prison cells, among other facilities</p>

                        <p>It remains an imposing building, helped in no small part by a restoration of its façade in
                            1979. In 2010 Grand Parade too was to receive a major facelift, making this block of the
                            city a major landmark.</p>
                        <p>Its lower walls and plinths use granite from the quarry on Signal Hill, whilst the

                            from Europe and Bath, in England.</p>
                        <p>Nelson Mandela gave a speech from the balcony of City Hall immediately upon his release from
                            prison. This was his first public address in 27 years, during which he spoke about his
                            commitment to democracy, peace and reconciliation..</p>

                            and is most certainly on every tourist’s must see list. Stretching along more than 20 blocks
                            of Cape Town's CBD, it lives up to its name and can take lazy strollers a full day to
                            explore. </p>
                        <p> After dark, the street comes alive in a new way. This time, the markets and shops give way
                            to a bustling nightlife, with bars and clubs keeping things going until early hours.</p>
                        <p>Above all else, what sets this long, vibrant street aside is its atmosphere. Whether
                            exploring by day, or heading out at night, Long Street is always fascinating.</p>
